To Do:
-fix aws to needed specifications
-join the room that was just created automatically (already have solution, but need to know if it will work)
-error in tagify but it still works
-get list of members in the chat



Summer:
(may)
-(can i use the date filter in the javascript like {{ data.message.sent_at|date:"F d"}} {{ data.message.sent_at|time:"g:i"}})
-avatars and notification for chat (check to see if solution is correct)
-check if room exists (boolean) and if it doesn't, create it then send message else switch to that room then send it
Or if you're not in a room when a message is sent check if room exists (boolean) and if it doesn't, 
create it and send the message else switch rooms then send it

(june)
-add unread functionality
-add online status away online offline and add classes for each (counter that you can manually adjust)
-show last message

(july)
-Add members to ongoing chat
-remove members from chat
-prepend chat clicked to top of list and save positioning even on reload
(either save data in browser/local storage or in database)

(august)
-get files that were sent in room and display them (maybe add progress bar for uploading)
-create tasks (reference figma)
-rename room



things to think about:
-if a single chat show status on profile picture and maybe a show members button to show whose active and whose in group
and if even one of the members in group is active give chat image an active status



 (value for tag input is set as the users in the room and then you can add additional ones from the tag-input then you 
click the create button to create that group) (how do i access that rooms users and do i need to stringify them before i add them to the value also
do i need a for loop to place each one in the value or can i add them to value all at once?)

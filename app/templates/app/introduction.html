            <h1 class="intro-title">UWLES Connect Website: Introduction</h1>
            <p class="intro-text">Welcome to the prototype for the UWLES Connect website! The purpose of this website is to help improve health literacy on the Eastern Shore of Maryland by 
                streamlining the workflow of case managers and clients, via tools such as chatting, resource sharing, and resource viewing. Today, we would greatly appreciate your feedback on the resource directory!
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">The resource directory is responsible for housing all the information regarding organizations, as well as personal documents for each user, 
                and it is broken up into three unique sections: The category directory, organizational directory, and the document directory. 
                The category directory is where you can search for organizations by category (health & fitness, addiction, disabilities, etc), 
                the organizational directory is where you can see all organizations in the system, 
                and the document directory is where all of your documents will be stored.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">If you have any problems while you are testing, please text 443-735-6440, or email kaaron1@gulls.salisbury.edu.
                 I will be available between 12pm-8pm everyday.
